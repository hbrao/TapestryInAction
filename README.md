Execute the command `ant deploy` to build the examples and deploy them into Tomcat. 

You may then launch Tomcat to execute the examples. The examples consist of four seperate Tapestry applications:

* http://localhost:8080/tiaexamples/app
* http://localhost:8080/bannerads
* http://localhost:8080/hangman1/app
* http://localhost:8080/hangman2/app


The Tapestry 3.0 libraries and dependencies are now directly included with this distribution.
