This distribution contains example source code to accompany the book:

  Tapestry in Action
  by Howard M. Lewis Ship
  Manning Publications
  ISBN 1932394117
  
The distribution is in the public domain, see LICENSE.txt for details.



The distribution requires a seperate download of Tomcat 5.0.25 (from
http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/). In addition, it includes build
scripts for Ant 1.5.2 or better (from http://ant.apache.org).

NOTE: The Ant build scripts are very dependent on the Tomcat version. It 
MUST be Tomcat 5.0.25.

You must create the file common/build.properties to tell Ant where
you have installed Tomcat. A sample file (build.properties.template)
is provided, which you may modify and rename.

Once configured, you may execute the command "ant" to build the examples
and deploy them into Tomcat. You may then launch Tomcat to execute the examples.

The examples consist of four seperate Tapestry applications:

[http://localhost:8080/hangman1/app](http://localhost:8080/hangman1/app)
[http://localhost:8080/tiaexamples/app]
[http://localhost:8080/hangman2/app]
[http://localhost:8080/bannerads]

UPDATE July 7 2004: 

The examples are now deployed as tiaexamples.war, so as not to conflict
with Tomcat's built-in examples. Previous versions of these examples overwrote
Tomcat's server.xml file, but this is no longer the case.

In addition, the Tapestry 3.0 libraries and dependencies are now directly
included with this distribution.

NOTE: References in the book to URLs starting with http://localhost:8080/examples 
should be changed to http://localhost:8080/tiaexamples.

This distribution has been tested with Tomcat 5.0.25 on Windows XP.
